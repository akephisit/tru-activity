# TRU Activity - Fixes Applied

This document outlines all the errors found and fixes applied to ensure the frontend and backend code works correctly.

## Backend Fixes

### 1. Updated Deprecated JWT Library
**Issue**: Using deprecated `github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go` package
**Fix**: Updated to `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4 v4.5.0`
- Updated import in `backend/pkg/auth/jwt.go`
- Changed `jwt.StandardClaims` to `jwt.RegisteredClaims`
- Updated time handling to use `jwt.NewNumericDate()`

### 2. Updated Redis Library
**Issue**: Using outdated Redis client library
**Fix**: Updated from `github.com/go-redis/redis/v8` to `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9 v9.3.0`

### 3. Fixed GraphQL Schema Naming Conflict
**Issue**: `Subscription` type was used for both database subscriptions and GraphQL subscriptions
**Fix**: Renamed database subscription type to `FacultySubscription`
- Updated GraphQL schema in `backend/graph/schema.graphqls`
- Changed all references to maintain consistency

### 4. Enhanced Health Check Endpoints
**Issue**: Missing proper health and readiness endpoints for deployment
**Fix**: Added comprehensive health endpoints in `backend/cmd/server/main.go`
- `/health` - Simple health check (returns "OK")
- `/ready` - Readiness check with database connectivity test

### 5. Improved Docker Configuration
**Issue**: Production Dockerfile lacked security and proper health checks
**Fix**: Enhanced `backend/Dockerfile`
- Added non-root user for security
- Added health check configuration
- Improved build process with proper CGO settings
- Added curl for health check support

### 6. Enhanced Environment Configuration
**Issue**: Missing environment variables for email notifications and QR codes
**Fix**: Updated `backend/.env.example`
- Added `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL_FROM`
- Added `SENDGRID_API_KEY`  
- Added `QR_SECRET_KEY`

## Frontend Fixes

### 1. Fixed Environment Variables with PUBLIC_ Prefix
**Issue**: SvelteKit requires PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side environment variables
**Fix**: Updated all frontend environment variables to use PUBLIC_ prefix
- Updated `.env.example` with PUBLIC_ prefixed variables
- Updated GraphQL client to use `env.PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_URL`
- Updated WebSocket client to use `env.PUBLIC_WS_URL`
- Updated deployment scripts to set PUBLIC_ variables
- Fixed codegen.ts to use static URL (codegen runs at build time)

### 2. Updated SvelteKit Adapter
**Issue**: Using adapter-auto which doesn't support Firebase Hosting
**Fix**: Updated `frontend/svelte.config.js`
- Changed to `@sveltejs/adapter-static` for static site generation
- Added proper Firebase Hosting configuration
- Fixed import paths and aliases

### 2. Added Missing Static Adapter Package
**Issue**: Missing `@sveltejs/adapter-static` dependency
**Fix**: Added to `frontend/package.json`

### 3. Enhanced GraphQL Client Configuration
**Issue**: Hardcoded API URLs in GraphQL client
**Fix**: Updated `frontend/src/lib/graphql/client.ts`
- Added environment variable support
- Proper fallback handling for development vs production

### 4. Fixed WebSocket Subscription Client
**Issue**: Missing WebSocket library and hardcoded URLs
**Fix**: Updated `frontend/src/lib/services/subscription-client.ts`
- Added `graphql-ws` dependency
- Updated to use environment variables for WebSocket URL
- Fixed import statements

### 5. Added Environment Configuration Files
**Issue**: Missing environment variable examples
**Fix**: Created `frontend/.env.example`
- Added proper environment variable documentation
- Included API URLs and configuration options

## Configuration Fixes

### 1. Updated Terraform Variables
**Issue**: Missing configuration examples for deployment
**Fix**: Created `infrastructure/terraform/terraform.tfvars.example`
- Added all required variables with descriptions
- Provided secure configuration guidelines

### 2. Enhanced Deployment Configuration
**Issue**: Missing deployment environment configuration
**Fix**: Created `.env.deploy.example`
- Added comprehensive deployment configuration
- Included monitoring and domain settings

### 3. Firebase Hosting Configuration
**Issue**: Missing Firebase configuration for frontend
**Fix**: Created proper `frontend/firebase.json`
- Added security headers
- Configured caching policies
- Added proper rewrites for SPA routing

## Security Improvements

### 1. Docker Security

### 2. CORS Configuration
- Proper CORS origins configuration
- Environment-specific settings

### 3. JWT Security
- Updated to latest secure JWT library
- Proper token validation and error handling

### 4. Environment Variables
- Proper secrets management
- Clear separation between development and production configs

## Build Process Improvements

### 1. Backend Build
- Added proper CGO disabled compilation
- Multi-stage Docker builds for smaller images
- Health check integration

### 2. Frontend Build
- Static site generation for better performance
- Proper environment variable injection
- Firebase Hosting optimization

### 3. Dependencies
- Updated all deprecated packages
- Added missing required dependencies
- Proper version pinning

## Deployment Ready Features

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` in frontend directory to install new dependencies
2. Update environment variables in `.env` files with actual values
3. Test the build processes:
   - Backend: `docker build -t tru-activity-backend ./backend`
   - Frontend: `npm run build` in frontend directory
4. Deploy using the provided deployment scripts
5. Verify health endpoints are working correctly
